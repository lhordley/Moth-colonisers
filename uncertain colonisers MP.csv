Scientific name,Immigrant or Adventive,TD comments,MP comment March 2023,Final decision,
Acleris abietana,A,Probably but slim chance of I,"A - Slightly tricky, but Aberfoyle (Perthshire) seems an unlikely place for a primary immigrant. One was seen in 1965 with another at the same site the following year. Non-native tree.",A,
Acrolepiopsis assectella,I,Not sure. Introduced to N. America (presumably in imported produce). Could have got here the same way,"I - MBGBI says mainly along coast of SE England; first found in Bexhill in 1942, Pratt suggests suspected  immigrant",NA,
Anarsia innoxiella,I,Could be overlooked resident as previously confused with another species,"I -See Gelechiid recording Scheme (lineatella and innoxiella) - 1st UK record 1991 at Walberton, W. Sussex (as lineatella). Lineatella now considered an adventive (but 1 record as a probable immigrant). Innoxiella clearly spreading",I,
Arctornis l-nigrum,I,Certainly now extinct. Records of a number of specimens in Sheffield in 18th C suggest it may get imported ,"I - recorded at Bradwell-on Sea, Essex and temporarily established (dying out in 1960). Waring et al (2017) refer to it as suspected immigrant. Most records seem coastal.",NA,
Argolamprotes micella,I,Not sure that overlooked resident can be excluded,I - first recorded in Devon in 1963 and has spread subsequently. Recent records in coastal Kent are suggestive of immigration,I,
Cacoecimorpha pronubana ,I,"Well known for being transported with cut flowers, etc so very debatable to call it I","I (probably) - Bradley, Tremewan & Smith - First record from Bognor, Sussex 1905 and in 1906 found breeding in Eastbourne, by 1907 found in Chiswick, London. By 1930s widely spread in Sussex and a pest in  greenhouses. Pratt refers to it as a suspected immigrant. He also says first taken in a house on Beachy Head Road, Eastbourne 1905, with the Bognor record also found the same year. Adkin (1925) suggested it had been accidentally imported, Pratt (2011) thinks immigrantion more likely",NA,
Caloptilla rufipennella,I,I guess so,"I (possibly) - First record Chippenham Fen, 1970, found as larval mine, and shortly after at Barton Mills, Suffolk. By time of MBGBI (1985), found in two disjunct areas. Could have have been overlooked for a few years prior to discovery. Feeds on Sycamore - are Sycamores imported?",NA,
Cameraria ohridella,A,That is the perceived wisdom but it spread rapidly west across Europe and I cannot see why it couldn't be I,"A - I found this on edge of Wimbledon Common (prob first UK record, but a member of public found them at similar time), flying around a young Horse Chestnut. London is also an unlikely place for primary immigrants, see also https://doi.org/10.1890/100098 - suggests may be associated with road developments. I recall seeing maps of spread in the UK (can't find them now), but spread out from London with little evidence of arrivals at the coast.",NA,
Carpatolechia alburnella,I,Can't help but feel that I is unlikely to that location. Overlooked resident?,"?? - First found Strensall Common, Yorkshire in 1927. Distribution doesn't look like an immigrant or a coloniser that has spread. Also on Birch so Adventive is unlikely. Possibly an overlooked resident, though that is a little surprising - don't know",overlooked resident,
Coleophora aestuariella ,I,I don't think that overlooked resident can be discounted,"I? - Goodey (2004) suggest it is a colonist. Given it is associated with Suaeda maritima its an unlikely Adventive. First found in 1981 on Kent coast, then found in Essex, numbersa increasing rapidly, then West Kent, can't rule out being an overlooked resident, but good microlepidopterists were around in Kent and Essex before it was first found, on balance probably Immigrant",NA,
Coleophora calycotomella,I,I would say a high probability that it is an overlooked resident,"Agree, most likely an overlooked resident given location (Surrey) and that it doesn't seem to have been found anywhere else still)",overlooked resident,
Coleophora fusicornis ,I,I don't think that overlooked resident can be discounted,"I - This should be amethystinella now - first found at Fingringhoe Wick, Essex in 1973. I think many subsequent records are largely coastal (being also found in Dorset, Hants and Suffolk, though is also now being found inland",I,Name needs to be changed to Coleophora amethystinella
Coleophora linosyridella,I,I don't think that overlooked resident can be discounted,"?? - On Sea Aster - MBGBI suggests foodplant regularly searched by microlepidopterists and there have been good microlepidopterists in the two counties it was found in (Kent/Essex), so seems unlikely it would be overlooked. An Adventive is unlikely, so most plausible is immigrant. But recently found on Goldilocks Aster in Devon where it has probably been overlooked (although a coastal site)",NA,
Croidosema plebejana,I,"No, I would definitely go for A","I - Pratt (2011) suggests suspected immigrant, also says first county records were in association with acuta, sacraria, armigera, vitrealis and vitellina. BTS (1979) say it has evidently been introduced and established. Earliest record, 1900 Street, South Devon, then not seen again until 1922 in north Devon and the third in south Devon in 1953. Confirmed breeding on Isles of Scilly in 1957. Recorded on Portland in 1958 - thatt pattern looks mor like an immigrant to me. Norfolk Moths says possible immigrant, Suffolk moths says regular immigrant",NA,
Cydia conicolona,I,Can't find any info on distribution abroad so cannot comment. V. odd that it doesn’t appear on any of the usual European web sites,"?? - First found in New Forest in 1930. Associated with Pines. Surprising number of coastal records, e.g. see Suffolk Moths and to a lesser extent Norfolk Moths. I seem to remember it tipped up in quite a large number of expected sites, but I can't recall the year - if so that hints at some sort of dispersal event. Don't know, but unlikely to have been an overlooked resident. If imported it would have had to have come in on cones, so perhaps immigrant is most likely?",NA,
Cydia milleniana ,I,I would have thought A more likely,A - First found 1944 in Thetford district and East Harling. Associated with Larch and only found in East Anglia. Would agree A is more likely,A,
Cydia pactolana,A,Seems most likely,"A - First found Alice Holt in 1965, then in Botley Wood in 1976. Apparently associated with younger Norway Spruce  and Larch (5-15 year old trees, see BTS (1979)",NA,
Ectoedemia hannoverella,A,"No, I","A? - First found Mildenhall, Suffolk in 2002. Widespread and often abundant in the Netherlands, Belgium (and elsewhere in Europe). In UK on Italian Poplar. Don't know, could be immigrant, but can't rule out accidental introduction given the hostplant (which can be bought at nurseries)",NA,
Ectoedemia sericopeza,A,"No, I","A? - First found Horseheath, Cambs in 1975, associated with Norway Maple. An unlikely place for an immigrant to be found and to my mind more likely an import with a sapling",NA,
Gelechia senticetella,A,Probably but I cannot be discounted completely,"A - associated with non native widely planted plants, first found in 1988 at Grays, Essex. Originally largely restricted to London area , but has started expanding more recently. MBGBI suggests Adventive. Gelechiid recording Scheme suggests presumably an adventive",A,
Lampronia flavimitrella,I,Overlooked resident?,"?? Don't know, unlikely to be an immigrant, poss. overlooked long term resident? First discovered Martyr Worthy, Hants in 1974, rarely noted with thinly scattered records all in SE England. Probably on bramble and raspberry",overlooked resident,
Monochora niphognatha ,I,Could be overlooked resident,"I? First found at Stodmarsh, Kent in 1984. Not found elsewhere except for 3 single recentish (post 2000) records (Devon, Sussex, Hants), two of which look to be coastal. Possibly associated with amphibious bistort",NA,
Monochroa hornigi,A,Could be overlooked resident,"A?. First found in Buckingham Palace Gardens in 1963, now has a scattered distribution in SE England, but north to Yorkshire. Seems to be associated with Persicaria, and usually only seen as singletons. Overlooked resident cannot be ruled out",NA,
Monochroa moyses,I,Could be overlooked resident,"I? First found 1971 at Mucking, Essex, associated with sea club-ruch. Now known between Dorset and Suffolk, coastal. Plenty of good microlepidopterists in some of these counties and coastal sites often comparatively well worked. Seems a bit unlikely it would have been overlooked, but......",NA,
Oegoconia novimundi,A,Could be overlooked resident,"A?. First found Barnet, Middlesex in 2011. Only a few examples known, but possibly currently overlooked as Oegoconia are seen as a difficult group. However, unlikely to have been overlooked longer term",NA,
Pammene ignorata,I,Could be overlooked resident. Also recorded in Devon in 1986,"Probably agree. First found Axminster, Devon in 1986, poss associated with ash, elm, lime. Could be a long term overlooked resident. Some Pammene are difficult to record",NA,
Pennisetia hylaeiformis,A,I think there must be some doubt about this,"A - unlikely to be an immigrant and overlooked resident would seem very unlikely. Associated with Raspberry, First found in 2007 in Meldreth, Cambs. Typically found in allotment, gardens etc. Has been fpound on a farm stocking only autumn fruiting raspberries. Has been suggested the increase in planting autumn fruiting varieties has enabled the species to survive, see Reiud (2010)",A,
Phlyctaenia perlucidalis,I,Well I suppose so but it seems an improbable place for first arrival of immigrants,I seems most likely explanation for this. Not likely to be an overlooked resident as fairly obvious and a adventive on thistles seems unlikely. First found in Woodwalton Fen in 1951,I,
Phyllocnistis ramulicola,I,"Seems highly unlikely, only known from UK & Portugal. Probably not native to either and A seems the most likely route of arrival to both","?Not sure, Adventive seems unlikely given hostplant. First found Havant Thicket, Hants in 1974, associated with sallows and only described new to science in 2007. Havant Thicket was well worked and this species was unlikely to have been overlooked at the site (Langmaid & Corley, 2007), unless in very low numbers.",NA,
Phyllomorcyter platani,A,"Strongly expanded range in Europe, I think equal chance of being I","A Associated with London Plain, first seen in South Kensington in 1990. An unlikely place for primary immigrants, also on non-native plant. Could easily have arrived on imported trees.",A,
Phyllonorycter geniculella,A,I,"?? Hard to know. First recorded Tubney,m Oxon in 1924, associated with Sycamore. Now widely found throughout the country",NA,
Phyllonorycter pastorella,A,Open to question,"A. First found in Buckingham Palace Gardens in 2014, associated with narrow-leaved willows. Now spreading  An unlikely place for a primary immigrant. Known to be spreading in Belgium and Netherlands",NA,
Phyllonorycter platanoidella,A,Open to question,"A. First found in 1962 at Denbies, Surrey. Associated with Norway Maple. Most likely an accidental introduction",NA,
Phyllonorycter strigulatella,A,Probably but level of recording then must open the possibility that it arrived as I and wasn't noticed till it reached Oxon,"A. First found in 1928 ay Cothill, Berks.  Associated with Grey Alder. Baker (1994) says evidently introduced with the tree giving (Waters, 1929) as the ref - that being A list of the Microlepidoptera of the Oxford District.",A,
Sclerocona acutellus,I,The general opinion is that this was imported with thatching materials so A,"Probably A for these purposes. Agree, clearly an import, but there are quite a few coastal records which hint at immigration as well. The Isle of Wight population appears to have gone, but there is an admitedly slim possibilty it is now resident at least temporarily in Norfolk and Dorset",A,
Stenoptilla millieridactyla,A,Probably but not sure that overlooked resident can be completely discounted,"A. First found in Chesterfield, Derbyshire in 1969. Associated with Saxifraga. Hart (2011) says accidentally intoruced into GB in late 1960s annd that the moth has almost exclusively been found in gardens., see p.87 which suggests plants were brought back from Dublin the year prior to the moth being found.",A,
Stigmella zelleriella,I,"No, undoubtedly overlooked resident","First found in 1957 at Sandwich, Kent. It appears to be highly restricted and associated with Salix repens. The location is well known for receiving immigrants from the continent but there seems little evidence to suggest this is an immigrant species, probably a longer term overlooked species due to its small size and restricted distribution",overlooked resident,
Strigmella suberivora ,I,"I guess so, although I'm not sure importation can be totally excluded","I?. First found in 1927 at Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. Hard to say, could have been accidentally introduced with planted trees, but equally given the location could have been an immigrant",NA,
Vitula serratilineella,I,More likely to be A given pattern of historic records,"I. First recorded on Spurn, Yorks in 1997 (and again recently), then Northumberland in 2016, where it is now resident. In 2021 seen recently near the Norfolk coast.",NA,
Xanthorhoe biriviata,A,Cannot see why this isn't I,"Don't know?? Associated with a non-native plant, mainly Orange Balsam, but also Small Balsam. First found in 1951 (according to Waring et al, 2017) at Dedham Lock, Middlesex. Waring et al (2017) give this as a suspected immigrant, Skinner (2009) suggest 'recent records fromcoastal sites in Suffolk, Essex, Kent and Dorset are most probably immigrants'. However, Middlesex seems an unlikely place for a primary immigrant and would more likely have been accidentally intoruced",NA,
